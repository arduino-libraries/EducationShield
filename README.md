Education Shield
========

The EducationShield library is intended to be used with the Education Shield provided in the CTC kit. It presents the necessary functions to interact with 3 and 4 pin connectors used in many sensors and actuators. Furthermore, it includes the functionality of SD-Card Reader and audio jack.

The current version (v1.3.1) of the library is to be used with the EducationShield V4.

The shield versions
The shield current version (V4) have the 3 pin connectors using the digital pin 9 and 6. The examples provided within the v1.3.1 library reflect this.   

Older versions
In older version of the shield, the 3 pin connectors uses the digital pin 9 and 10. The pre v1.3 of the library, works with this shield.

CTC Project
===========

This is an educational project carried by Arduino LLC in Malmo. It is a collection of exercises commissioned by the Center of Resources for Education at Castilla La Mancha to be tried out in the classrooms during the Spring 2013.

The content of this repository is the materials generated for a first try out with schools and includes exercises, texts, and code.
