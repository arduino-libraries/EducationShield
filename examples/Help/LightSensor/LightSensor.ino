/*
* LightSensor
*
* LightSensor is a sensor that reads the intensity of light. 
* It gives analog reading. When connected with analog 
* pins, its value ranges from 0 to 1023 depending on the amount 
* of light shining on it. 
*
* The EducationShield library includes some features for 
* using the LightSensor as a button, or get values directly. See 
* the example LightSensortest fo more information about how to 
* configure it correctly.
