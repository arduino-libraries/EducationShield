/* 
* Piezo Knock Sensor
* Piezo can play music, as well as used as knock sensor.
*
* Connect the red pin of the piezo to a 1m ohm resistor, 
* and the resistor to an analog pin(A5 in this example), 
* the other pin to GND. Connect a 3.3v zener diode in 
* parallel to the piezo and resistor circuit, with its 
* anode to GND, cathode to A5.
