/*
* IRArray
* This program will print each IR sensor reading to the 
* serial monitor.
* 
* When you hold the IRarray over a white surface all sensors 
* should give you a value of 400. When held over a black surface 
* it should go down to around 330. Make sure that you've 
* connected all sensor pins right by alternate each sensor 
* between black and white and see the that values of the 
* corresponding IR sensor is changing. E.g. if you move IR1 from 
* black to white but only the value of IR2 is changed you need 
* to either change the analog pins in the code or change the 
* connections to the analog pins on the control board.
