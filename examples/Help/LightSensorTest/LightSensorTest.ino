/*	LightSensor test
*	This sketch should be used prior to using the component in
*	Projects. Projects suitable for this library should have 2
*	states: uncovered and covered. That is to say, you want to
*	track objects covering/moving pass the sensor.
*
*	HOW-TO:
*	Upload this sketch to the control board, open the serial monitor. You
*	will see the current value of the phototransistor.
*
*	Make sure the sensor is in its desired setting and not
*	moving. When the value gets stable, take note of it(we call
*	it "baseValue").
*
*	Now cover the sensor with desired object. When the value
*	gets stable, take note of it(topValue). Remembe these values
* and use them when configuring.
*
*	"baseValue" and "threshold" will be used for defining the
*	LightSensor switch in your project. You can fine tune the 
* threshold to make the sensor more/less sensitive. The closer 
* to baseValue, the more sensitive it is.
